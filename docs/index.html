    <h2>How To Use?</h2>

    <h3>Install</h3>
    <p>The package is on NPM:</p>
    <pre><code>npm install sowstring</code></pre>

    <h3>Usage</h3>

    <p>For NodeJS, just require the file:</p>
    <pre><code class="js">var SowString = require ("sowstring").SowString;<br><br>var tree = SowString (sourceString, optionsObject);</code></pre>

    <p>On browsers, include the script:</p>
    <pre><code class="xml">&lt;script src=&quot;path/to/library/dist/sowstring.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
 
    You will have <code>SowString</code> registered globally in the <code>window</code> object. The function has the classes <code>SowString.Node</code> and <code>SowString.Leaf</code> as well.

    <h3>Options</h3>
    <p>Options should be passed as an object to the second argument of <code>SowString (source, { options:here })</code> function, and all its fields are optionals:</p>

    <p><code class="pretty">emptyLines</code> (Boolean) &mdash; when true, preserve the empty lines in the final tree items. When false, empty lines will be entirely ignored. <strong class="never-break">Default: false</strong>.</p>
    <p><code class="pretty">error</code> (Function) &mdash; when provided, it executes always when the indent is invalid in the string or made invalid by the <code>intercept</code> function. The function is called without arguments, with an handler object as <code>this</code> and ignores returns. It is the last chance to fix manually an indent error, and whether it is not fixed, it will fix automatically or throw an exception, according to <code>fixIndent</code> option. <a href="#interceptor-class">See below</a> for a complete reference of the <code>this</code> object passed to the function, and its uses. <strong class="never-break">Default: null</strong>.</p>
    <p><code class="pretty">fixIndent</code> (Boolean) &mdash; when true, indent errors will be fixed automatically, if not <code>error</code> handler, nor <code>intercept</code> callback take care of it. If false, an exception is thrown, identifying the error and line of occurence. <strong class="never-break">Default: false</strong>.</p>
    <p><code class="pretty">intercept</code> (Function) &mdash; when provided, it executes the function for each line. The function is called without arguments, with an handler object as <code>this</code> and ignores returns. <a href="#interceptor-class">See below</a> for a complete reference of the <code>this</code> object and its uses. The function will not handle empty lines. <strong class="never-break">Default: null</strong>.</p>
    <p><code class="pretty">tabReplace</code> (String or Number) &mdash; set this option to the string that will replace every TAB character (ASCII: 9), or to the amount of spaces that replace it. <strong class="never-break">Default: string with 4 whitespaces</strong>.</p>
    <p><code class="pretty">useHeading</code> (Boolean) &mdash; when true, tree omits each item before arrays of nodes and set those line as <code class="pretty">heading</code> attributes of nodes. The option itself is saved in the tree outter node as <code>useHeading</code> to remember the tree scheme. <strong class="never-break">Default: false</strong>.</p>
 
    <h4 id="interceptor-class">Intercept and Error context object (this)</h4>
    <p>The callbacks <code>error</code> and <code>intercept</code> passed to the options are called without arguments. The handling is made through the <code>this</code> object. The object has some useful informations and functions to handle various cases. See below a list of properties and functions:</p>
    <p><code class="pretty">hasErrors</code> (Boolean) &mdash; inform if the current indent is invalid according to the tree. <a href="#invalid-indent">See the section</a> about invalid indent below.</p>
    <p><code class="pretty">indent</code> (Number) &mdash; get or set the indent of the item. The indent is given by the number of whitespaces before the line start. Its concept is the same as the code indentation. Strings indented with 2 spaces will also have the indents multiple of 2 (0, 2, 4, 6&hellip;).</p>
    <p><code class="pretty">level</code> (Number) &mdash; get or set the level assigned to the item. The level is the height of the item in the tree, according to the indent, being no indent the level 0, the first indent the level 1 and so on&hellip;</p>
    <p><code class="pretty">lineNum</code> (Number, readonly) &mdash; number of the line currently being parsed in the given string.</p>
    <p><code class="pretty">startIndent</code> (Number, readonly) &mdash; inform the original indent of the item when the function was called. This value will not update during the function execution.</p>
    <p><code class="pretty">startLevel</code> (Number, readonly) &mdash; inform the original level of the item when the function was called. This value will not update during the function execution.</p>
    <p><code class="pretty">text</code> (String) &mdash; get or set the text assigned to the item. The initial value is the line of the string assigned with the item.</p>
    <p><code class="pretty">discard ()</code> (no return) &mdash; the item and line will be completely ignored and will not be included in the resulting tree. Use this function to remove lines on the fly.</p>
    <p><code class="pretty">getProp (name)</code> (returns the value) &mdash; get a custom property previously assigned to the current item.</p>
    <p><code class="pretty">setProp (name, value)</code> (no return) &mdash; set a custom property to the current item. This is useful to assign the item with custom fields related to the user logic. There are some reserved names which you cannot use: <code>constructor</code>, <code>prototype</code>, <code>indent</code>, <code>level</code>, <code>lineNum</code>, <code>parent</code> and <code>children</code>.</p>
    <p><code class="pretty">setChild ()</code> (no return) &mdash; causes the item to be a child of the previous appended item. The item will have the same indent as the previous plus 1.</p>
    <p><code class="pretty">setParent ()</code> (no return) &mdash; causes the item to back to the parent level of the previous appended item. The item will have the same indent as the parent of the previous item.</p>
    <p><code class="pretty">setSibling ()</code> (no return) &mdash; causes the item to be a sibling of the previous appended item. The item will have the very same indent as the previous item.</p>
    <p><code class="pretty">setSiblingOfNext ()</code> (no return) &mdash; the item will not be appended in the tree while the next item is not appended. When the next item is appended, all the stack of "siblings of next" are appended before it, in the same level. It is the same process used to fix invalid indentations.</p>

    <h3>Tree to String</h3>
    <p>If you want to get back the tree as a string, you can use the <code>toString</code> method in the most outter (root) node. This node is the tree itself, which is returned from the <code>SowString</code> function.</p>
    <pre><code class="js">var myString = myTree.toString ()</code></pre>
    <p>Here we also have options, which is also a plain object:</p>
    <pre><code class="js">var myString = myTree.toString({<span class="placeholder">&hellip;options&hellip;</span>})</code></pre>
    
    <h4>Options</h4>
    <p><code class="pretty">details</code> (Boolean) &mdash; If true, the resulting string will include a note between brackets <code>[ ]</code> defining if the object is a Node or Leaf, and the line that generated the item. <strong class="never-break">Default: false</strong>.</p>

    <h2 id="invalid-indent">Invalid indent and poisonous trees</h2>
    <p>If the string has inconsistent indentation, it msut be treated before the item is added on the tree.
    If no process fix the error, and <code>fixIndent</code> is false, an error of type
    <code class="pretty">Error</code> will be thrown informing the line of occurence. Otherwise, the fixed indent
    is assigned to the item.</p>
    <p>For example, consider the following tree:</p>
    <pre>Parent<br>    Node 1<br>    Node 2<br>   Node 3<br>    Node 4</pre>

    <p>Observe the <q>Node 3</q> item, it has one space less than the previous
    item, but has three spaces more than the parent. It can be hard to realize
    what were the intention of the user. For the computer, the item cannot be the parent,
    as it has much more indentation, and cannot be a sibling because it is very little indented.
    So, it is not a parent, sibling or child, and there's no other state in our
    tree.</p>

    <h3>Solution I</h3>
    <p>This issue can be solved automatically by the library passing the option
        <code>fixIndent</code> as <code>true</code>. In this case, the item awaits
        for the next inclusion and is appended as sibling of next item.</p>

    <h3>Solution II</h3>
    <p>The user can set an <code>error</code> callback in the options. So, if the
        line as any issue relative to its indent, the function is called and the
        user can set a valid indent using the <code>this</code> object. If this
        function just call <code>this.setSiblingOfNext ();</code>, this code will
        do exactly the same as the <code>fixIndent</code> option.</p>
    <p>If the error is not really solved in this option, the algorithm will fallback
        to the <code>fixIndent</code> option. If the option is not enabled, an error
        is thrown.</p>
    <p>This approach can be combined with solution I and executes before that.</p>

    <h3>Solution III</h3>
    <p>The user can also check for indent errors in the <code>intercept</code>
        function passed in the options. The check can be made using the <code>hasErrors</code>
        field of the <code>this</code> object. If the indent has errors, the user can
        fix it manually.</p>
    <p>The <em>intercept</em> function is executed before the <em>error</em>
        function, and both execute before the automatic fix (<code>fixIndent</code>).
        Then, the first try of the library is to use the <em>intercept</em> function,
        if there is an error in the indent, the <em>error</em> function is called and,
        if the error wasn't solved, the automatic fix is executed or an error is thrown. </p>
    <p>This approach can be combined with solution I and II and executes before them.</p>
